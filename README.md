# Homework 0

You are currently in the "GitHub repository (repo)" for HW-0.

## HW Submission Exercise

This exercise will guide you through the HW submission process for the semester. 

1. **Fork (make a copy) of the repo**:
    a. In the top right corner of the page, click on *Fork*. This forks a copy of this original repo to your own GitHub account.
    a. In the top left of the page, you should see "YOURGITHUBID/HW-0 forked from Middlebury-Data-Science/HW-0" in blue. This is your fork (copy) of the repo which you will be editing.
    a. Copy the contents of the HTTPS field to your clipboard
1. **Create an *RStudio Project* based on this repo**: From RStudio go to *File* -> *New Project...* -> *Version Control* -> *Git* and 
    1. Paste the clipboard contents into Repository URL
    2. Type `HW-0` at the project directory name.
    3. Select the project subdirectory. I suggest creating a new folder called `MATH216` first and selecting the project to be a subdirectory of that.
1. **Do your homework**: Edit `HW-0.Rmd` and Knit it
1. **Push (sync) your changes to GitHub**:
    + Select the *Git* panel. You will see a list the files that were modified.
    + Click the checkboxes of all files to select them for syncing with GitHub and click *Commit*. This stages the files to commit, i.e. to check if GitHub can accept these changes.
    + Add a brief commit message describing your changes and click *Commit*.
    + Click *Push*. This will push (upload) your changes to GitHub.
1. **Submit your homework**:
    + Go to your fork on GitHub and ensure that the files have updated.
    + Click *New pull request*. This is a request that I pull in your changes so I can view them.
    + Click *Create pull request*
    + In the title field type your name and leave a comment, then click *Create pull request*. I will get an email notification.

And you're done!


## Things to Keep in Mind

1. Once you've forked a copy of HW-X, you should only be looking at the GitHub page of your fork marked "YOURGITHUBID/HW-X forked from Middlebury-Data-Science/HW-X" in blue on the top right, and not the original repo marked "Middlebury-Data-Science/HW-X".
1. You can access a list of all your forked repos by cliking on your picture icon on the top right of any GitHub page -> *Your Profile* -> selecting the *Repositories* tab
1. RStudio projects are self-contained meaning you can only push file changes to GitHub if you are currently working in that project. If you want to switch between projects, in the top right of RStudio you can toggle between projects by clicking on the arrow.
