## HW Submission Exercise

This exercise will guide you through the HW submission process for the semester. You are currently in the "GitHub repository (repo)" this test HW.

1. **Fork (make a copy) of the repo**:
    a. In the top right corner of the page, click on *Fork*. This forks a copy of this original repo to your own GitHub account.
    a. In the top left of the page, you should see "YOURGITHUBID/Testing forked from Middlebury-Data-Science/Testing" in blue. This is your fork (copy) of the repo which you will be editing and not the original repo.
    a. Copy the contents of the HTTPS field to your clipboard
1. **Create an *RStudio Project* based on this repo**: From RStudio go to *File* -> *New Project...* -> *Version Control* -> *Git* and 
    1. Paste the clipboard contents into Repository URL
    2. Give your desired project directory name. I suggest `Testing`.
    3. Select the project subdirectory. I suggest creating a new folder called `MATH216` first and selecting the project to be a subdirectory of that.
1. **Do your homework**: Edit `Testing.Rmd` and Knit it
1. **Push (sync) your changes to GitHub**:
    + Select the *Git* panel. You will see a list the files that were modified.
    + Click the checkboxes of all files to select them for syncing with GitHub and click *Commit*. This stages the files to commit, i.e. to check if GitHub can accept these changes.
    + Add a brief commit message describing your changes and click *Commit*.
    + Click *Push*. This will push (upload) your changes to GitHub.
1. **Submit your homework**:
    + Go to your fork on GitHub and ensure that the files have updated.
    + Click *New pull request*. This is a request that I pull in your changes so I can view them.
    + Click *Create pull request*
    + In the Title field type your name and leave a comment, then click *Create pull request*. I will get an email notification.

And you're done!


## Things to Keep in Mind

1. Once you've forked a copy of whatever HW, you should only be looking at the GitHub page of your fork marked "YOURGITHUBID/Testing forked from Middlebury-Data-Science/HW-XX" in blue on the top right and not the original repo marked "Middlebury-Data-Science/HW-XX". 
1. You can access a list of all your forked repos by cliking on your picture icon on the top right of the screen -> *Your Profile* -> selecting the *Repositories* tab
1. RStudio projects are self-contained. If you want to switch between projects, in the top right of RStudio you can toggle between projects by clicking on the arrow.
